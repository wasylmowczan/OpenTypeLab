## Getting Started

When contributing to OpenTypeLab, it's good to know our best practices, tips, and tricks. First, OpenTypeLab is written in SvelteKit and CSS; thus, we assume you are comfortable with these languages or have basic knowledge of them. Our backend is in NodeJS and we use Supabase to store our user data and authentication. Furthermore, we use Prettier to format our code.
